A few things worth mentioning: I am a very political person, radical left, I talk about politics here and on all my profiles. I have <em>a lot</em> of <em>very</em> strong opinions about <em>a lot</em> of things. I&rsquo;m a punk, but I&rsquo;m also really into the goth subculture as well. I&rsquo;m brazilian, which means english is not my first language. I am very queer I don&rsquo;t care about gender I like everyone, I am also a trans man. I&rsquo;m a furry, a brony, and whatever other evil titles I can adopt. I am in fact employed and pursuing a higher education (calm down ladies I know). I&rsquo;m also really good at <a href=https://www.roblox.com/games/147848991/Be-A-Parkour-Ninja rel=external>Be a Parkour Ninja</a>

And the people you <em>can</em> talk about it with, 9 times out of 10 are not exactly someone you want around you.</p><style>.imgwrapper{display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap;align-items:baseline;gap:1rem}</style><div class=imgwrapper><style>figure{text-align:center;margin:1rem 0;word-wrap:break-word;width:20rem;max-width:80vw}figure img{object-fit:contain;margin-bottom:.5rem}figcaption{font-style:italic}</style><figure><picture><source type=image/gif media="(max-width: 640px)" srcset=/amendokat/about_me/smoking_hu_2c3c898c290c9ce2.gif><source type=image/gif media="(max-width: 1007px)" srcset=/amendokat/about_me/smoking_hu_e523462dceb127db.gif><source type=image/gif media="(min-width: 1008px)" srcset=/amendokat/about_me/smoking_hu_548ae5a8e7d07c0f.gif><img src=/amendokat/about_me/smoking_hu_2c3c898c290c9ce2.gif alt="Girl smoking stressed." width=320 height=223 loading=lazy></picture><figcaption>Visual representation of how the last few months have been feeling.</figcaption></figure></div><h3 id=my-hobbies>My hobbies:</h3><p>Drawing, coding, listening to music and archiving.
