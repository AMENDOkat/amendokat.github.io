A mutual I had made Chrysalis&amp;rsquo;s horn out of clay and some guy even made a comic dub! It&amp;rsquo;s the first time anything like this ever happened to me. Gosh I wish I could track that comic dub down&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t have it saved anymore :(&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>G5 COMIC SPOILERS DON'T LOOK</title><link>https://amendokat.github.io/art_gallery/artwork/oldglow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://amendokat.github.io/art_gallery/artwork/oldglow/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hoax G5 comic I made for my AU. Some people actually fell for it at the time lol. Unfortunately most of those comments are now lost as they happened on my defunct X account, but the ones from Tumblr are still accessible if you wanna check it out. I remember a comment I got about how they thought it was &amp;ldquo;pony shigaraki&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
