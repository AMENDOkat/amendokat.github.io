Published Nov 14 2025</span><hr><p>I had originally planned for my first blog post on this site to be an &ldquo;indie web manifesto&rdquo;, in the fashion of many other webmasters around here. If you don&rsquo;t know, an indie web manifesto is a piece of writing that details your thoughts on the indie web movement and social media as a whole, mostly explaining why you&rsquo;ve decided to create a website and why social media sUckZx so much!1! But I found, through my current draft and all the ones that came before, that this issue is infinitely more complex than it may seem at a first glance.</p><p>Social media is an incredibly nuanced topic to discuss, even with years of study it takes a while to make a draft that really means something. And, under my increasing desperation to publish this site that&rsquo;s been in the works for so long, I have postponed it. None of my current drafts cover everything that I want to discuss, to the degree I want to, and I feel it&rsquo;s holding back the site&rsquo;s release unnecessarily when I could just publish it at a later date.</p><p>So, here it is. My first post and it&rsquo;s not an indie web manifesto. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what to write. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to make this site for so long and I had so many ideas for it - a lot of them, much like the manifesto, postponed because I was getting too desperate and just wanted to get <em>something</em> out there. I decided to make a website when I found out about Neocities around 2 years ago, since then, there&rsquo;s been about 3 drafts for it. Three times I&rsquo;ve built the entire thing from the ground up, and now it&rsquo;s finally done.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a few reasons I can list about why I wanted to make a site. They&rsquo;re really cool, they make me look cool, they&rsquo;re incredibly helpful - being an artist, it&rsquo;s very handy to have some place where people can see all of my art, links and information - and it&rsquo;s a platform I can use to publish <em>anything else</em> I want. It&rsquo;s a lot less pressure too. I don&rsquo;t expect people to read this. It&rsquo;s a lot of work to click on someone&rsquo;s website and check their blog posts - I mean, it&rsquo;s not, but it&rsquo;s more work than the grand majority of the population is willing to put in. It&rsquo;s not any work for people to get my posts on Bluesky, I click &ldquo;post&rdquo; and they just show up on their feeds. It makes me anxious when I don&rsquo;t get any replies or likes back because <em>I know</em> people saw them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s nice to have a place to be myself and share my creations with the world without all that pressure social media puts on you. It&rsquo;s really nice, actually. It&rsquo;s a <a href=https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Cozy_Glow title=cozy>cozy
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
space I can call mine. It&rsquo;s also really gratifying making something and seeing the results of your work on the screen. I like working on the site, it&rsquo;s not in any way a chore. I do it <em>because</em> it&rsquo;s fun. If I just wanted a homepage, without any of the work, I would&rsquo;ve just kept my carrd.</p><p>I have so many ideas for the future here, you can check them out at the roadmap. And if you have any suggestions, I&rsquo;d love to hear it! The site is mine, but I want it to be <em>for</em> everyone. I put work into making it performant, accessible and the code is completely open source. I believe the internet should be free and for everyone, and it&rsquo;s one of my drives for making this place. Sharing my skills and knowledge with the world for whomever may find them useful. Even if that knowledge is something &ldquo;irrelevant&rdquo; like what&rsquo;s my favourite brand of ready made cappuccino.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all I have to say for now. Websites are awesome and I wanted to make one. I take great pride in my work as I&rsquo;ve put so much love and so many hours into it. And I want other people to enjoy it too, maybe not as much as I do, but to have a good time here nonetheless.</p><p>See y&rsquo;all next post glowers! &#x1f434; stay glowing &#9823;&#xfe0f;</p></div></main><footer><span>coded by AMENDOKAT with his own two paws &#x1F43E;</span>
