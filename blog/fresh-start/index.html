| Last Modified Feb 04 2026</span><hr><p>I had originally planned for my first blog post on this site to be an &ldquo;indie web manifesto&rdquo;, in the fashion of many other webmasters around here. If you don&rsquo;t know, an indie web manifesto is a piece of writing that details your thoughts on the indie web movement and social media as a whole, mostly explaining why you&rsquo;ve decided to create a website and why social media sUckZx so much!1! But I found, through my current draft and all the ones that came before, that this issue is infinitely more complex than it may seem at a first glance.</p><p>Social media is an incredibly nuanced topic to discuss, even with years of study it takes a while to make a draft that really means something. And, under my increasing desperation to publish this site that&rsquo;s been in the works for so long, I have postponed it. None of my current drafts cover everything that I want to discuss, to the degree I want to, and I feel it&rsquo;s holding back the site&rsquo;s release unnecessarily when I could just publish it at a later date.</p><p>So, here it is. My first post and it&rsquo;s not an indie web manifesto. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what to write. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to make this site for so long and I had so many ideas for it - a lot of them, much like the manifesto, postponed because I was getting too desperate and just wanted to get <em>something</em> out there. I decided to make a website when I found out about Neocities around 2 years ago, since then, there&rsquo;s been about 3 drafts for it. Three times I&rsquo;ve built the entire thing from the ground up, and now it&rsquo;s finally done.</p><style>.figure-wrapper{display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap;align-items:baseline;gap:1rem}</style><div class=figure-wrapper><style>.page-figure{text-align:center;margin:1rem 0;word-wrap:break-word;width:20rem;max-width:80vw;max-height:19rem}.page-image{object-fit:contain;margin-bottom:.5rem;max-height:15rem;background-color:#373737}.page-caption{font-style:italic}</style><figure class=page-figure><a href=https://raccooncomic.com/post/634430277597511680/113-story-idea><img srcset="/blog/fresh-start/codeidea_hu_f21c316dc9bed030.webp 320w,

They&rsquo;re really cool, they make me look cool, they&rsquo;re incredibly helpful - being an artist, it&rsquo;s very handy to have some place where people can see all of my art, links and information - and it&rsquo;s a platform I can use to publish <em>anything else</em> I want. It&rsquo;s a lot less pressure too. I don&rsquo;t expect people to read this. It&rsquo;s a lot of work to click on someone&rsquo;s website and check their blog posts - I mean, it&rsquo;s not, but it&rsquo;s more work than the grand majority of the population is willing to put in. It&rsquo;s not any work for people to get my posts on Bluesky, I click &ldquo;post&rdquo; and they just show up on their feeds. It makes me anxious when I don&rsquo;t get any replies or likes back because <em>I know</em> people saw them.</p><style>.figure-wrapper{display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap;align-items:baseline;gap:1rem}</style><div class=figure-wrapper><style>.page-figure{text-align:center;margin:1rem 0;word-wrap:break-word;width:20rem;max-width:80vw;max-height:19rem}.page-image{object-fit:contain;margin-bottom:.5rem;max-height:15rem;background-color:#373737}.page-caption{font-style:italic}</style><figure class=page-figure><img srcset="/blog/fresh-start/cool_hu_fb552ee17fcc9cb3.webp 320w," sizes="(max-width: 641px) 320px,
