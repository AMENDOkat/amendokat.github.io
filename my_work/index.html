I&rsquo;m a hobbyist artist, I work mainly on digital. My illustrations have a really big focus in color, brush work and textures. Painting is my favorite part of the process, and what I consider my biggest strength as well. I put hours of work, love and dedication in every single one of my pieces, and I feel like they really show it.
Most of my work is fan art. Specifically My Little Pony fan art, specifically the character Cozy Glow, as I&rsquo;ve been deathly obsessed with her and the show for quite a few years now. But occasionally I draw other media and even my own characters."><meta property="og:description" content="My Art

Nowhere near where I&rsquo;m at on my art journey, but I know a thing or too. My coding experience mostly comes from this website, it&rsquo;s two previous (now scrapped) drafts and a other minor things: bash/batch commands to automate a few tasks on my desktop, CLI applications such as <a href=https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp title=yt-dlp>yt-dlp

.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t do commissions or freelance coding work because I am not confident enough in my abilities as a programmer to do so. But if you have a question you think I might be able to answer, I&rsquo;d be more than glad to help out.</p><p>I have definite plans to develop my coding skills as I would very much like to work on my own applications, contribute to my favorite open source projects and make an indie game.</p><p>As of now my plan is to pick up learning Python and Javascript.</p></div></main><footer><span>coded by AMENDOKAT with his own two paws &#x1F43E;</span>
