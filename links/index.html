Brony who makes drunk recaps of MLP episodes. He abandoned the channel after quitting alcoholism, but most of the videos are still available to watch. My favorite videos are (predictable):

&#10138; and 

Totally Legit Recap: &ldquo;School Raze&rdquo; (Part 2) MLP Season 8 Episode 26 - DWK

I don&rsquo;t particularly agree with some of the stuff this guy has to say, specially the whole AI bs, but I find that his videos on the dark web and opsec in general are actually very well informed and he&rsquo;s really good at explaining stuff so anyone can understand it. I would recommend his channel if you&rsquo;re ever interested in learning about those topics.

<em>Who doesn&rsquo;t know THE internet archive?!?</em> In case you don&rsquo;t, It&rsquo;s an archive of &ldquo;everything&rdquo; that&rsquo;s on the internet. They also have old video games, magazines, books, movies, software etc. etc. <em>And</em> they archive webpages via the

The best adblocker and annoyance-get-ridder you can get. You&rsquo;re never gonna see an ad again. Free, open source, doesn&rsquo;t work on Chrome (that&rsquo;s a positive for me), works seamlessly with Firefox.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp title=yt-dlp rel=external>yt-dlp
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
The most powerful video and audio downloader that exists currently. Completely free, open source and runs everywhere. <em>Every other video downloader out there is, 9 times out of 10, a wrapper of yt-dlp.</em> Yt-dlp is a command line application with a heap of options. If you&rsquo;re not very tech savvy or just don&rsquo;t wanna bother learning it,
<a href=https://cobalt.tools/ title="Cobalt Tools" rel=external>Cobalt Tools
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup> is a great alternative. <em><del>CT is a yt-dlp wrapper</del> CT is <strong>not</strong> a yt-dlp wrapper, however, much like all wrappers, it&rsquo;s options are much more limited than yt-dlp - i&rsquo;d personally recommend you just pick up yt-dlp already and stop jumping hoops - there&rsquo;s tons of support out there, the documentation is great, and it&rsquo;s incredibly reliable, you&rsquo;re never gonna have trouble when you need to download a video or song ever again.</em></li><li><a href=https://jellyfin.org/ title=Jellyfin rel=external>Jellyfin
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
Free, open source media library. It&rsquo;s like having your own offline Netflix and you can organize it however the hell you want. It&rsquo;s AWESOME!!! It also has a pretty large library of plugins, a personal favorite of mine is
<a href=https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin title="Youtube Metadata" rel=external>Youtube Metadata
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>. It grabs the JSON file you downloaded with your video (<em>
<a href=https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp title=yt-dlp rel=external>yt-dlp
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup> hint hint</em>) and makes Jellyfin process the info from that file so it thinks the video is just a standard movie or episode from a show you downloaded, which means it can actually organize and read them properly. For someone who&rsquo;s never used any program like this, it may seem stupid, but believe me, once you try doing anything web related in a media library like Jellyfin or Plex (JF but worse), you&rsquo;ll understand why this is a lifesaver. <em>Can you tell I&rsquo;m into this stuff?</em></li><li><a href=https://www.qbittorrent.org/ title=qBittorrent rel=external>qBittorrent

Note taking app in markdown. Very complete, has an extensive online community and plugin library - anything you think you could ever think to do with a text file, Obsidian probably a way to do it. Would you believe me if I said most of the pages for this site were written there? When I was done I just dropped them into HUGO to do it&rsquo;s magic. Pretty cool, huh?

Like yt-dlp but for images. I have a love hate relationship with it. Not as powerful as yt-dlp, <em>ridiculously</em> hard to use and the documentation doesn&rsquo;t help because it FUCKING SUCKS.

Great channel for learning if you&rsquo;re just getting started with HTML, CSS and JS.

The three websites you&rsquo;re gonna see the most when searching up anything HTML, CSS and JS related. MDN Web Docs and W3Schools both feature documentation on all the different tags and functions ur gonna encounter on your coding journey. Mozilla&rsquo;s documentation is a lot more complete, but also harder to understand, for beginners W3Schools is better. Different from the last two, Stack Overflow is a forum for asking questions, chances are whatever weird quirk you have going on with your code, someone else&rsquo;s already encountered it before and asked that question there.</li></ul><h3 id=tools>Tools</h3><ul><li><a href=https://ezgif.com/optimize title="Ezgif GIF compressor" rel=external>Ezgif GIF compressor
