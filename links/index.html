I don&rsquo;t particularly agree with a lot of what this guy has to say, specially the whole AI bs, but I find that his videos on the dark web and opsec in general are actually very well informed and he&rsquo;s really good at explaining stuff so anyone can understand it. I would recommend his channel if you&rsquo;re ever interested in learning about those topics.

The most powerful video and audio downloader that exists currently. Completely free, open source and runs everywhere. <em>Every other video downloader out there is, 9 times out of 10, a wrapper of yt-dlp.</em> Yt-dlp is a command line application with a heap of options. If you&rsquo;re not very tech savvy or just don&rsquo;t wanna bother learning it, <a href=https://cobalt.tools/ title="Cobalt Tools">Cobalt Tools
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
is a great alternative. <em>CT is a yt-dlp wrapper and like all wrappers it&rsquo;s options are much more limited than the base program, i&rsquo;d personally recommend you pick up yt-dlp directly, there&rsquo;s tons of support out there, the documentation is great, and it&rsquo;s incredibly reliable, you&rsquo;re never gonna have trouble when you need to download a video or song ever again.</em></li><li><a href=https://jellyfin.org/ title=Jellyfin>Jellyfin
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
Free, open source media library. It&rsquo;s like having your own offline Netflix and you can organize it however the hell you want. It&rsquo;s AWESOME!!! It also has a pretty large library of plugins, a personal favorite of mine is <a href=https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin title="Youtube Metadata">Youtube Metadata
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
. It grabs the JSON file you downloaded with your video (<em><a href=https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp title=yt-dlp>
yt-dlp
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
hint hint</em>) and makes Jellyfin process the info from that file so it thinks the video is just a standard movie or episode from a show you downloaded, which means it can actually organize and read them properly. For someone who&rsquo;s never used any program like this, it may seem stupid, but believe me, once you try doing anything web related in a media library like Jellyfin or Plex (JF but worse), you&rsquo;ll understand why this is a lifesaver. <em>Can you tell I&rsquo;m passionate about this stuff?</em></li><li><a href=https://www.qbittorrent.org/ title=qBittorrent>qBittorrent

Note taking app in markdown. Very complete, has an extensive online community and plugin library - anything you think you could ever think to do with a text file, Obsidian probably a way to do it.

Like yt-dlp but for images. I have a love hate relationship with it. Not as powerful as yt-dlp, <em>ridiculously</em> hard to use and the documentation doesn&rsquo;t help because it FUCKING SUCKS.

Great channel for learning if you&rsquo;re just getting started with HTML, CSS and JS. Do keep in mind though, I would only recommend his tutorials if you never had any contact whatsoever with these coding languages and have limited programming knowledge. Once you start to learn more, you realize he glazes over a lot of important concepts in order to keep the videos simple and understandable. Again, great for beginners, not so great if you already know some stuff.

The three websites you&rsquo;re gonna see the most when searching up anything HTML, CSS and JS related. MDN Web Docs and W3Schools both feature documentation on all the different tags and functions ur gonna encounter on your coding journey. Mozilla&rsquo;s documentation is a lot more complete, but also harder to understand, for beginners W3Schools is better. Different from the last two, Stack Overflow is a forum for asking questions, chances are whatever weird quirk you have going on with your code, someone else&rsquo;s already encountered it before and asked that question there.</li></ul><h3 id=tools>Tools</h3><ul><li><a href=https://ezgif.com/optimize title="Ezgif GIF compressor">Ezgif GIF compressor

<strong>Not exactly for beginners</strong> Must learn if you&rsquo;re serious about web development, but if you just wanna make casual sites, you can skip it. Very powerful tool, but at the very core of it, it&rsquo;s just uploading your site to a remote folder (repository) so you have a backup and nice list of changes you can revert back to if you mess up something.

<strong>I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING OUT WITH WEB DEVELOPMENT</strong> Hugo is a static site generator, it&rsquo;s blazing fast, super popular so there&rsquo;s lots of support out there and it&rsquo;s gonna help you automate <em>so much</em> dumb website making stuff. Pages are written in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown title=markdown>markdown
</a><sup title="External link" class=external-link-marker>&#10138;</sup>
